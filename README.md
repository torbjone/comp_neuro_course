# Teaching material for NMBU course in computational neuroscience

This repository contains teaching material for FYS388/FYS488. 

The exercises can be executed on the EBRAINS collaboratory without the need to install any software on your local computer.
LFPy, and other needed software, is preinstalled at the EBRAINS collaboratory, and running these exercises should therefore be easy.
Note, however, that the correct 'kernel' for the Jupyter Notebooks must be used for LFPy to be directly available.

This requires a free EBRAINS account, which can be made here:
https://www.ebrains.eu/page/sign-up

Alternatively, you can attempt to install NEURON, LFPy, and NEST on your local computer (not recommended for Windows users).

Recipe for using the EBRAINS collaboratory:
  1) Go to https://wiki.ebrains.eu/bin/view/Main/, log in and click "Collabs" on the top right.
  2) Click the button "Create a collab".
  3) Make up some personal collab name ("Karis_compneuro"), and set visibility to "Private". Click "Create Collab".
  4) Press "Lab" on the left, and chose Execution Site. Which site you chose should mostly be irrelevant.
  5) In the Jupyter Notebook, press the button on the leftmost bar that is named "Git" (hover over with the mouse to see the name).
  6) Press the button "Clone a Repository", and give the URL https://github.com/torbjone/comp_neuro_course.git
  7) Under the folder "Exercises", you should now find examples and exercises. Find and click on a Jupyter Notebook.
  8) When it opens, make sure the Jupyter Notebook kernel (button on the upper right side) is set to "EBRAINS-25.02" (or similar).
